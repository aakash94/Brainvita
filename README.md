Also known as [peg solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) is a classic single player puzzle.


## About :
Little bit about the game. Check out the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) for more information.
#### Board :
This repository considers the english version of the game. The english version has 33 holes on the board shaped in the form of a cross. All the holed on the boad are filled up with balls/pegs(referrd to as balls henceforth) at the start except for the one at the very centre. 
#### Rules : 
A move in this game is when a ball jumps over a ball to land on an empty space. The ball can only move in either of the 4 directions, top, bottom, left and right. The ball that the original ball jumps over is then removed from the board. 
#### Objective : 
The objective here is to get rid of all the balls on the board except the last one by having a ball jump over it. The game ends when no further move is possible.
If only 1 of the 32 balls remain on the board the game is said to be solved.
It is easy to see that the solution is also the longes game that can be possibly played with 31 moves. 



## Reinforcement Learning :
> "Are neural networks really necessary here?" is a seriously underasked question. - Some article I read online.

I would not blame someone asking the same question about reinforcement learning here. With that said, the main objective of this exercise is to use RL to navigate possible board states and find a solution without any form of tree search or look ahead.
#### Approach : 

#### Optimistic Initialization : 
A technique to ensure ecploration till we find the solution.
